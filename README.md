# Systematic_Literature_review
The analysis was conducted using the Pyscopus plugin for python (84). Pyscopus is a wrapper for the scopus API; scopus is the world’s largest database of peer reviewed literature. The search used the query function “TITLE-ABS-KEY” which searches for a set of words within the title, abstract, and keywords section of all papers within the scopus database. Additionally a proximity factor “w/10” was used indicating that the key words should be within 10 words of each other, this was done to ensure results actually referred to the FEW nexus and not abstracts which simply had all of those words present. This approach means that papers which discuss only two nodes of the nexus, for example a paper about the water-energy nexus, were excluded unless the full nexus was explicitly mentioned.
